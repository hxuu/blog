# Algorithm to writing a good writeup

## Preliminaries

[x] 1. do your review of the references you used to solve the challenge.

[ ] 2. who is your audience?
=> the kind of article: a ctf writeup (how a player solved solved a challenge)
=> it is intented for ctf participants that couldn't solve the challenge, BUT always the reviewers
=> Reviewers of CTF writeups typically look for clarity, correctness, reproducibility, insight, brevity, originality, and style
=> you can spot brevity in a writeup when it avoids fluff and rambling, uses direct explanations and minimal setup

## The big picture

- producing the first draft is the creative part of the job. Editing that first job is the analytical part.
- your job is to produce a complete first draft, not a perfect first draft.

### The algorithm

[ ] 1. just get started

[ ] 2. work from an outline
=> Challenge overview (description, title, category...etc)
=> TL;DR (summary of the whole challenge, at least 50 words but not more than 100)
=> Initial analysis (application wide analysis - looking at the app as a whole and hinting at a suspection)
=> Task analysis (diving deeper into that single point of failure or of vulnerability)
=> Exploitation (crafting the payload and delivering the attack)
=> Conclusions (what was learned from this challenge - in list format)
=> References (links to more detail)

[ ] 3. do not write the introduction-like stuff now! (it induces procrastination)
=> The easiest part to write is the experimental (actual code, exploitation)

[ ] 5. move forward to other sections except the introduction. analyze and review the task analysis and exploitations.

[ ] 6. Produce the conclusions: in a list format.

[ ] 7. do the introduction:
=> Why was i drawn into the task analysis topic? 'why did seem fishy in the app?'
=> Give the reader sufficient background to clear it for him why you did what you did.

[ ] 8. get the exact references for everything you said (the exact anchors)
